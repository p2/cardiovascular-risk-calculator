			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>What does this calculator do?</h2>
			<p>This cardiovascular risk calculator provides you with an interactive and individualized tool which provides an absolute estimate (%) of a person's chance of having a cardiovascular event over a specific period of time and an idea of the potential benefit of treatment. It is only valid for people who have never had a cardiovascular event.</p>
			You can choose between 3 different databases by clicking on a specific calculator at the top.</p>
			1) <b>Framingham</b> - this calculates the risk of heart attacks + angina/coronary insufficiency + heart failure + strokes + intermittent claudication</p>
			2) <b>QRISK<sup>&reg;</sup>2-2014</b> - this calculates the risk of heart attacks + strokes</p>
			3) <b>ACC/AHA ASCVD</b> - this calculates the risk of CHD death + nonfatal heart attacks + fatal/nonfatal strokes
			<p>This calculator was designed to dynamically show how the value of specific risk factors impact cardiovascular risk. Results are shown using a representation of 100 "happy faces" to help illustrate risk. This format seems to be one of the better ways to present risks visually. Risks are also provided as absolute numbers and rounded off to one decimal point even though <b>any cardiovascular estimates likely are +/- 5-10% at best.</b></p>
			<p>There are TWO different views for this calculator. An ENHANCED VIEW which displays all the different types of interventions including non-drug, drugs for cholesterol, drugs for statins, drugs for blood pressure, drugs for glucose. The BASIC VIEW displays only non-drug, statins and ASA as interventions and all patient variables need to be inserted before any numbers are presented. In addition, it only displays three different faces - those with no event, those with an event, and those for benefit. You can toggle back and forth between the two different views.</p>
		
			<h2>How do I use the Absolute CVD Risk/Benefit Calculator?</h2>
		
			<h3>1) Enter the unmodifiable factors</h3>
			<p>These are the factors that really can't be changed - age, gender, ethnicity/race.</p>
		
			<h3>2) Enter the modifiable factors</h3>
			<p>These are factors that can mostly be modified with lifestyle changes or medications - smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes.</p>

			<h4>Framingham</h4>
			<p>a) smoking status - yes or no</p>
			<p>b) diabetes - yes or no</p>
			<p>c) systolic blood pressure in mmHg - the calculator uses 120mm/Hg to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>d) total cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>e) HDL&nbsp;cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 1.3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
		
			<h4>QRISK<sup>&reg;</sup>2-2014</h4>
			<p>a) smoking status - yes or no</p>
			<p>b) diabetes - yes or no</p>
			<p>c) systolic blood pressure in mmHg - the calculator uses 120mm/Hg to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>d) on treatment for BP - the calculator only applies this if systolic blood pressure is >120 mmHg</p>		
			<p>e) total cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>f) HDL&nbsp;cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 1.3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>		
			<p>g) family history of CVD, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis - yes or no</p>		
			<p>h) height/weight - BMI is calculated automatically and if height and weight are not entered it imputes a value of 25kg/m2the calculator</p>
		
			<h4>ACC/AHA ASCVD</h4>
			<p>a) smoking status - yes or no</p>
			<p>b) diabetes - yes or no</p>
			<p>c) systolic blood pressure in mmHg - the calculator uses 120mm/Hg to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>d) on treatment for BP - the calculator only applies this if systolic blood pressure is >120 mmHg</p>
			<p>e) total cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
			<p>f) HDL&nbsp;cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 1.3 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>		
		
			<h3>3) Estimate benefit</h3>
			<p>Estimate of benefit - clicking on an intervention like Physical Activity, Mediterranean Diet vs Low Fat, Vitamin/Omega-3 supplements, (if SBP is >/= 140 mmHg) BP Meds, (regardless of cholesterol) Low-mod intensity statins, High intensity statins, Fibrates, Niacin, Ezetimibe, (if diabetic) Metformin, Sulfonylureas, Insulins, Glitazones, GLPs, DPP-4s, Meglitinides, SGLT2 and ASA will input a specific relative benefit and this will be applied to the absolute risk to calculate the % of people who could benefit from a therapy. Examples of relative benefits are taken from a synopsis of the best available evidence - see below for more details</p>

			<h3 id="percentage">ABSOLUTE NUMBERS - calculated risk and benefits</h3>
			<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>NO EVENT</strong> BLUE FACES - are the % of people who would NOT have an event over the time period</p>
			<div>
			<p>b)&nbsp;<strong>TOTAL WITH AN EVENT</strong> RED/PINK FACES - are the % of people who will have an event over the time period</p>			
			<p>d)&nbsp;<strong>NUMBER WHO BENEFIT&nbsp;</strong> GREEN FACES - are the % of people who would not have an event because of "treatment" and is based on reducing the absolute risk of an event by the relative estimate of benefit</p>			
			<p>d)&nbsp;<strong>NNT&nbsp;</strong>is the number needed to treat and is infinity unless a treatment that has a benefit is added</p>			
				<p>b) <strong>BASELINE&nbsp;EVENTS</strong> RED FACES - are the % of people who would have an event if they had "baseline" risk factors (non-smoker, non-diabetic, SBP = 120, Total cholesterol = 3, HDL = 1.3)</p>
				<p>c) <strong>ADDITIONAL EVENTS</strong> PINK FACES - are the % of people who would have an event <strong>OVER AND ABOVE</strong> the baseline rate and is that risk attributable to the persons specific risk factors</p>

			</div>
	
		
			<h2 id="benefit">Where do the estimates of benefit come from?</h2>
			<p>The table below includes a reasonable estimate of the relative benefits of certain "therapies" and comes from a variety of meta-analyses and studies. They have been rounded off and some of the numbers have far more solid evidence behind them than others.  Not all evidence shows the same numbers so there has been some neccesary personal judgement involved as well. One can apply these numbers to the individual patient's absolute risk by clicking on the specific treatment. Risk reductions for diabetes drugs only apply if the patient has been identified as a diabetic. For blood pressure, while somewhat arbitrary, risk reductions only apply if the patient has a blood pressure of 140mmHg or greater. A recent Cochrane review (CD006742) suggested that "Antihypertensive drugs used in the treatment of adults (primary prevention) with mild hypertension (systolic BP 140-159mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90-99mmHg) have not been shown to reduce mortality or morbidity in RCTs." In addition, the ACCORD study (type 2 diabetics) showed no benefit of lowering blood pressure below 140mmHg. However, a recent meta-analysis suggest that a benefit is achieved regardless of baseline systolic blood pressure. BMJ 2009;338:b1665doi:10.1136/bmj.b1665.</p>

			<h2>Why aren't surrogate marker or treatment thresholds provided?</h2>
			<p>You will notice there are no designated target or treatment thresholds from guidelines. These were purposely not added as they are arbitrary and one should use a reasonable estimate of risks and benefits to help facilitate shared-informed decision-making.</p>
		
			<h2>Diabetes and smoking aren't really yes or no risk factors, what gives?</h2>
		
			<h3 id="smoking">Smoking</h3>
			<p>Smoking history is typically based on self-report. It is unclear exactly what should constitute a smoker. What seems reasonable is that if a person has been a smoker over the last 5 years they should be considered a smoker. If they stopped smoking 5-10 years ago they should likely be considered a non-smoker for the purposes of cardiovascular risk calculation. However, it is important to remember that smoking also increases the risks for cancers and lung disease and these risks may not be as reversible when a person becomes a non-smoker.
			</p>
		
			<h3 id="diabetes">Diabetes</h3>
			<p>Many cardiovascular risk calculators identify diabetes as a yes or no variable. Framingham defines diabetes as a fasting glucose of &gt; 7mmol/L (126 mg/dL) for the offspring cohort or 7.8 (140) for the original cohort. It is clear however that diabetes is not a yes or no risk factor. Based on the UKPDS risk engine for every 2% increase in A1c, over 6%CVD risk goes up 33%. Type-2 diabetes also increases the chance of microvascular disease. Compared to macrovascular risks the absolute risk of hard microvascular endpoints like renal failure or blindness are far less frequent. However incidence data is not as robust for these endpoints. In UKPDS 34 less than 1% of patients developed renal failure over 11 years and roughly 5% developed blindness in one eye. In STENO, in which patients also had microalbuminuria, 8% of patients in the standard treatment group went on dialysis and 9% became blind in at least 1 eye over 14 years. Vijan et al estimated a 60-year-old diabetic with an A1c of 9% has a lifetime chance of dialysis of around 1 in 100 and a similar lifetime chance of blindness.</p>
		
			<h2>Why aren't risk factors like family history and lifestyle included in the Framingham and ACC/AHA ASCVD calculators?</h2>
			<p>These calculators use age, gender, SBP, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking and diabetes to calculate cardiovascular risk. Calculator specific adjustments for family history, weight, BMI etc are not available for these calculators. However we have added some guidance as to the impact of family history and one can adjust the overall risk by adding a variable percentage. These modifications are not sanctioned by the original groups who developed these calculators.</p>
		
			<h2 id="framingham">What specific outcomes do the cardiovascular terms include and how are they defined?</h2>
			<h3>1) Framingham</h3>		
			<h3>Angina</h3>
			<p>A brief recurrent chest discomfort of up to 15 minutes duration, precipitated by exertion or emotion and relieved by rest or by nitroglycerine AND coronary insufficiency = prolonged (&gt;15 minutes) chest pain but no indication of heart tissue damage.</p>
		
			<h3 id="chd">Coronary heart disease (CHD)</h3>
			<p>CHD = fatal/non-fatal heart attacks + angina/coronary insufficiency.</p>
		
			<h3 id="cvd">Cardiovascular disease (CVD)</h3>
			<p>CVD = coronary heart disease (CHD) + heart failure + strokes + intermittent claudication.</p>
		
			<h3 id="heart_attack">Heart attack</h3>
			<p>Heart attacks = fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions.</p>
			<p>Acute, recent, or old - an acute myocardial infarction is defined as the presence of at least two of three findings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>symptoms indicative of ischemia;</li>
				<li>changes in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis;</li>
				<li>serial changes in the electrocardiograms indicating the evolution of an infarction, including the loss of initial QRS potentials (that is, development of "pathologic" Q-waves of 0.04 second duration or greater).</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>Heart failure</h3>
			<p>A minimum of two major or one major and two minor criteria to be present concurrently</p>
			<p>Major Criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea;</li>
				<li>Distended neck veins (in other than the supine position);</li>
				<li>Rales;</li>

				<li>Pulmonary edema, visceral congestion, cardiomegaly shown on autopsy;</li>
				<li>Weight loss on CHF Rx: 10 lbs./5days.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Minor criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bilateral ankle edema;</li>
				<li>Night cough;</li>
				<li>Dyspnea on ordinary exertion;</li>
				<li>Hepatomegaly;</li>
				<li>Pleural effusion by x-ray;</li>

				<li>Tachycardia (120 beats per minute or more);</li>
				<li>Pulmonary vascular engorgement on chest x-ray.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>Intermittent claudication</h3>
			<p>A cramping discomfort in the calf clearly provoked by walking some distance with the pain appearing sooner when walking quickly or uphill and being relieved within a few minutes by rest.</p>
		
			<h3 id="stroke">Stroke</h3>
			<p>A sudden or rapid onset of a focal neurologic deficit persisting for greater than 24 hours AND Transient ischemic event (TIA) = a focal neurologic deficit of sudden or rapid onset that fully resolves in less than 24 hours.
			</p>
			<h3>2) QRISK<sup>&reg;</sup>2-2014</h3>
			<p>Heart attacks and strokes.</p>
			<h3>3) ACC/AHA ASCVD</h3>
			<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease = CHD death + nonfatal heart attacks + fatal/nonfatal strokes.</p>

			<h1>Questions fréquemment posées</h1>
			<h2>Qu'est-ce que cette calculatrice fait?</h2>
			<p>Cette calculatrice de risque cardiovasculaire est un outil interactif qui estime la probabilité (%) qu'une personne ait un événement cardiovasculaire au cours d'une période de temps donnée et celle du bénéfice potentiel d'un traitement. Ces estimations sont valides uniquement pour les personnes qui n'ont jamais eu un événement cardiovasculaire.</p>
			<p>Vous pouvez choisir entre 3 différentes bases de données en cliquant sur une calculatrice spécifique dans le menu en haut de votre écran.</p>
			1) <b>Framingham</b> - celui-ci calcule le risque d'infarctus + angine / insuffisance coronarienne + insuffisance cardiaque + accident vasculaire cérébral + claudication intermittente</p>
			2) <b>QRISK<sup>&reg;</sup>2-2014</b> - celui-ci calcule le risque d'infarctus + accident vasculaire cérébral</p>
			3) <b>ACC/AHA ASCVD</b> - celui-ci calcule le risque de décès par maladie coronarienne+ infarctus non mortel + accident vasculaire cérébral mortel/non mortel
			<p>Cette calculatrice a été conçue pour montrer de façon interactive comment des facteurs de risque spécifiques influent sur le risque d'événements cardiovasculaires. Les résultats sont présentés en utilisant 100 "visages heureux/malheureux" pour aider à illustrer le risque. Ce format semble être l'une des meilleures façons de représenter visuellement les risques. Ceux-ci sont également fournis sous forme de nombres absolus et arrondis à une décimale près, même si la précision de l'estimation des risques cardiovasculaires peut varier de ± 5-10%.</p>
			<p>Deux modes d'affichage sont disponibles. Un affichage COMPLET offre l'ensemble des interventions, y compris les interventions non-médicamenteuses, les médicaments pour le cholestérol dont les statines, les médicaments pour l'hypertension artérielle et les médicaments pour le diabète. L'affichage DE BASE offre uniquement les interventions non-médicamenteuses, les statines et l'aspirine. Dans ce mode d'affichage, tous les paramètres du patient doivent être inscrits  avant que les estimés de risque cardiovasculaire apparaissent. De plus, il ne présente que trois "visages heureux" différents - celui sans événement, celui avec un événement et celui des bénéfices. Vous pouvez changer le mode d'affichage à votre guise.</p>

			<h3>3) Voyez le bénéfice estimé</h3>
			<p>En cliquant sur une intervention, la calculatrice en détermine le bénéfice relatif spécifique et l'applique pour calculer le % de personnes qui pourraient bénéficier de cette intervention. Les interventions disponibles sont: 1) Activité physique, 2) Alimentation méditerranéenne vs Faible teneur en gras, 3) Vitamines / suppléments d'oméga-3, 4) Médication anti-hypertensive (si la TA systolique est > ou = 140 mmHg), 5) Statines à intensité faible-modérée, Statines à haute intensité , Fibrates, Niacine, Ézétimibe (quel que soit le taux de cholestérol), 6) Metformine, Sulfonylurées, Insulines, Glitazones, GLP-1, DPP-4, Meglitinides et  SGLT2 (si diabétique) et 7) ASA. Le bénéfice en termes relatifs provient d'une synthèse des meilleures études disponibles - voir ci-dessous pour plus de détails.</p>

			<h2 id="benefit">Sur quoi les estimations des bénéfices relatifs sont-elles fondées?</h2>
			<p>Le tableau ci-dessous présente une estimation acceptable des bénéfices relatifs de certaines interventions préventives et provient d'une variété de méta-analyses et d'études. Les estimations varient d'une étude à l'autre et ont été arrondies. Le niveau de "preuves" sur lesquelles elles s'appuient est variable.  La sélection des estimations repose donc en partie sur le jugement des auteurs de cette calculatrice. On peut appliquer ces estimations du risque relatif pour calculer le risque absolu d'une personne en cliquant sur l'intervention spécifique. Le calcul de la réduction absolu de risque avec les médicaments contre le diabète se fait uniquement si le patient a été identifé comme diabétique. Pour la pression artérielle, bien que quelque peu arbitraire, le calcul de la réduction du risque ne se fait que si le patient a une pression artérielle de 140mmHg ou plus. Une récente revue Cochrane (CD006742) indique que les médicaments antihypertenseurs utilisés chez les adultes en prévention primaire de maladies cardiovasculaires et souffrant d'hypertension légère (TA systolique 140-159mmHg et / ou diastolique 90-99mmHg) ne réduisent pas la mortalité ou la morbidité. De plus, l'étude ACCORD (chez les diabétiques de type 2) n'a montré aucun avantage à baisser la pression artérielle systolique sous 140 mmHg. Cependant, une méta-analyse récente suggère qu'un bénéfice est réalisé indépendamment de la pression artérielle systolique initiale. BMJ 2009; 338: b1665doi: 10.1136 / bmj.b1665.</p>

			<h2>Pourquoi n'avons-nous pas donné de cibles de traitement à atteindre, particulièrement pour les paramètres de substitution (cholestérol, TA, glycémie)?</h2>
			<p>Vous remarquerez qu'il n'y a pas de cibles de traitement contrairement à ce que l'on retrouve dans de nombreux guides de pratiques cliniques. Ceci a été fait à dessein, car ces seuils ont été fixés de façon arbitraire, sans ou avec peu de bases scientifiques. La prise de décision partagée/informée pour initier ou poursuivre une intervention devrait se fonder sur une estimation raisonnable des risques et des bénéfices de cette intervention et non sur l'atteinte de valeurs cibles de paramètres de substitution.</p>

			<h2>Pourquoi la catégorisation présent ou absent (oui ou non) ne s'applique pas intégralement au tabagisme et au diabète?</h2>

			<h3 id="smoking">Tabagisme</h3>
			<p>Les antécédents de tabagisme sont généralement basés sur ce que le patient rapporte. On ne sait pas exactement qui devrait être considéré comme "fumeur". Une personne qui a fumé au cours des 5 dernières années devrait raisonnablement être considérée comme fumeur. Si elle a cessé de fumer il y a 5-10 ans, elle devrait probablement être considérée comme non-fumeur pour les fins du calcul du risque cardiovasculaire. Cependant, il est important de se rappeler que le tabagisme augmente également les risques de cancers et de maladies pulmonaires. Cette augmentation du risque de ces maladies ne disparait pas nécessairement quand une personne cesse de fumer.
			</p>

			<h3 id="diabetes">Diabète</h3>
			<p>De nombreux calculateurs de risque cardiovasculaire identifient le diabète comme une variable "présent ou absent" (oui ou non). Dans l'étude de Framingham, les personnes de la cohorte initiale ont été considérées comme diabétique si leur glycémie à jeun était de > 7,8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) alors que leur progéniture l'était avec une glycémie à jeun de > 7mmol / L (126 mg / dL). Il est cependant clair que le diabète n'est pas un facteur de risque "présent ou absent" . Si on se base sur l'étude UKPDS, pour chaque augmentation de 2% de l'Hb1ac au dessus d'une valeur de 6% d'Hb1ac, le risque de maladies cardiovasculaires augmente de 33%. Le diabète de type-2 augmente également le risque de maladies microvasculaires. Comparativement au risque de complications macrovasculaires, celui de complications microvasculaires comme l'insuffisance rénale ou la cécité est beaucoup moins grand et les données d'incidence ne sont pas aussi robustes pour ces paramètres. Dans l'étude UKPDS, moins de 1% des patients ont développé une insuffisance rénale en 11 ans et environ 5% ont développé la cécité d'un œil. Dans l'étude STENO, dans laquelle les participants diabétiques avaient également une microalbuminurie, 8% des patients du groupe d'étude avec traitement usuel ont eu recours à une dialyse et 9% sont devenus aveugles d'au moins 1 oeil au cours de 14 ans de suivi. Vijan et al. ont estimé qu'un diabétique de 60 ans avec une l'Hb1ac de 9% a un risque d'environ 1% au cours de sa vie de nécessiter une dialyse ou de souffrir de cécité.</p>

			<h2>Pourquoi les facteurs de risque comme les antécédents familiaux et le mode de vie ne sont-ils pas inclus dans les calculatrices ASCVD, Framingham et ACC / AHA?</h2>
			<p>Ces calculatrices utilisent l'âge, le sexe, la TA systolique, le cholestérol total, le cholestérol HDL, le tabagisme et le diabète pour calculer le risque cardiovasculaire. Des ajustements spécifiques  pour des facteurs comme les antécédents familiaux, le poids, et l'IMC ne sont pas disponibles pour toutes ces calculatrices. Nous avons toutefois permis d'estimer l'impact de l'histoire familiale en ajoutant un % de risque supplémentaire associé à ce facteur.  Soulignons que cette modification n'est pas sanctionnée par les groupes qui ont développé ces calculatrices.</p>

			<h1>Часто задаваемые вопросы</h1>
			<h2>Какие возможности даёт калькулятор?</h2>
			<p>Калькулятор сердечно-сосудистого риска предоставляет собой интерактивный и индивидуализированный инструмент, дающий возможность получить оценку вероятности (%) развития сердечно-сосудистого осложнения за определённый период времени и убедить пациента в потенциальной пользе лечения. Он предназначен для оценки людей, у которых ранее не было сердечно-сосудистых осложнений.</p>
			Нажав кнопку отдельного калькулятора в верхней части страницы, вы можете сделать выбор между тремя различными базами данных
			<p></p>
			1) <b>Фрамингемская шкала</b> - оценивает риск сердечных приступов + стенокардии/коронарной недостаточности + сердечной недостаточности + инсультов + перемежающейся хромоты
			<p></p>
			2)<b> QRISK</b><sup><b>®</b></sup><b>2-2014</b> - оценивает риск сердечных приступов и инсультов
			<p></p>
			3) <b>ACC/AHA ASCVD</b> - оценивает риск смерти от ИБС + нефатальных сердечных приступов + фатальных/нефатальных инсультов.
			<p>Калькулятор был разработан для того, чтобы в динамике показать, как отдельные факторы риска влияют на общий сердечно-сосудистый риск. Результаты показаны в виде 100 "счастливых лиц". Такой формат представляется одним из лучших способов сделать информацию о риске наглядной. Также приводится абсолютное значение риска с точностью до десятых, окрулённое в меньшую сторону, несмотря на то, что <b>точность оценки сердечно-сосудистого риска в лучшем случае +/- 5-10%.</b></p>
			<p>Есть ДВЕ версии этого калькулятора. В РАСШИРЕННОЙ ВЕРСИИ отражены различные типы вмешательств, включая, немедикаментозные меры, приём препаратов, снижающих уровень холестерина, в том числе статинов, антигипертензивных и сахароснижающих препаратов. В БАЗОВОЙ ВЕРСИИ отражены только немедикаментозные меры, назначение статинов и аспирина и всех показателей пациентов, и все параметры пациентов, которые необходимо ввести перед тем, как появятся оценки. Кроме того, в ней, при помощи различных типов лиц, показана доля пациентов без осложнений, с осложнениями и у которых отмечается улучшение. Вы можете переключать вид калькулятор, меняя версию и возвращаясь обратно.</p>
			<h2>Как использовать калькулятор абсолютного риска ССЗ/пользы вмешательств?</h2>
			<h3>1) Укажите немодифицируемые факторы</h3>
			<p>Есть факторы, которые нельзя изменить - возраст, пол этническую и расовую принадлежность.</p>
			<h3>2) Укажите модифицируемые факторы</h3>
			<p>Эти факторы могут быть в существенной степени изменены при помощи коррекции образа жизни или приёма препаратов: курение, повышение артериального давления и уровня холестерина, сахарный диабет.</p>
			<h4>Фрамингем</h4>
			<p>a) курение - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>b) сахарный диабет - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>c) систолическое артериальное давление в мм рт.ст. - для оценки исходного риска используется значение 120 мм рт.ст. </p>
			<p>d) общий холестерин в ммоль/л - для оценки исходного риска в калькуляторе используется значение 3 ммоль/л</p>
			<p>e) холестерин ЛПВП в ммоль/л - для оценки исходного риска в калькуляторе используется значение 1,3 ммоль/л</p>
			<h4>QRISK<sup>®</sup>2-2014</h4>
			<p>a) курение - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>b) сахарный диабет - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>c) систолическое артериальное давление в мм рт.ст. - для оценки исходного риска используется значение 120 мм рт.ст.</p>
			<p>d) Приём антигипертензивных препаратов - калькулятор использует это, если систолическое давление &gt; 120 мм рт.ст.</p>
			<p>e) общий холестерин в ммоль/л - для оценки исходного риска в калькуляторе используется значение 3 ммоль/л</p>
			<p>f) холестерин ЛПВП в ммоль/л - для оценки исходного риска в калькуляторе используется значение 1,3 ммоль/л</p>
			<p>g) семейный анамнез сердечно-сосудистых осложнений, хроническая болезнь почек, фибрилляция предсердий, ревматоидный артрит - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>h) рост/вес - ИМТ расчитывается автоматически, а если рост и вес не введены, по умолчанию используется значение 25кг/м2</p>
			<h4>ACC/AHA ASCVD</h4>
			<p>a) курение - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>b) сахарный диабет - "да" или "нет"</p>
			<p>c) систолическое артериальное давление в мм рт.ст. - для оценки исходного риска используется значение 120 мм рт.ст.</p>

			<h3>3) Оценка пользы</h3>
			<p>Оценка пользы - выбирая вмешательства, такие как физическая активность, средиземноморская диета или диета с пониженным содержанием жира, пищевые добавки с витаминами/омега-3 ненасыщенными жирными кислотами, (если САД &gt;/= 140 мм рт.ст.) антигипертензивные препараты, (вне зависимости от уровня холестерина) статины в низкой дозе, статины в высокой дозе, фибраты, ниацин, эзетимиб, (если пациент страдает сахарным диабетом) метформин, сульфонилмочевина, инсулин, глитиазоны, ГПП, ингибиторы ДПП-4 (глиптины), меглитиниды, ингибитор натрий-глюкозного-котранспортера-2 (SGLT2) и аспирин будут обеспечивать специальную относительную пользу, которая будет сопоставлена с абсолютным риском, для того, чтобы расчитать % людей, которые получат улучшение от лечения. Примеры относительной пользы взяты из представлений о лучших доказательных данных, более подробно - см.ниже</p>

			<h2 id="benefit">Откуда беруться оценки пользы от вмешательств?</h2>
			<p>В таблице ниже приводятся обоснованные оценки относительной пользы отдельных видов "вмешательств", полученные в различных исследования и мета-анализах. Они были до некоторой степени округлены, и отдельные опираются на значительно более убедительные доказательные данные. Не все доказательные данные приводятся в виде численных значений, в изложении отдельных - использованы субъективные суждения. Можно использовать эти численные значения для оценки абсолютного риска у пациента, выбирая отдельные виды лечения. Снижение риска, связанное с приёмом сахароснижающих препаратов возможно только, если у пациента ранее был установлен сахарный диабет. Снижение риска, связанное с повышенным артериальным давлением, оценивается только, если его величина 140 мм рт.ст.. В выполненном недавно Кокрановском обзоре (CD006742), указано, что "Использование антигипертензивных препаратов для лечения взрослых (первичная профилактика) с артериальной гипертензией I степени (систолическое АД 140-159 мм рт.ст./или диастолическое АД 90-99 мм рт.ст.), в РКИ не было показано снижение смертности и заболеваемости." Кроме того, в исследовании ACCORD (сахарный диабет 2 типа) было показано отсутствие пользы от снижения артериального давления ниже 140 мм рт.ст.. Однако, данные последнего мета-анализа указывают, что польза достигается вне зависимости от исходного систолического артериального давления. BMJ 2009;338:b1665doi:10.1136/bmj.b1665.</p>

			<h2>Почему приводятся значения оценки сурогатных маркеров или пороговых величин лечения?</h2>
			<p>Необходимо помнить, что в руководствах не существует обозначенных целевых или пороговых значений. Поэтому, мы сознательно не включали их, если они были произвольными, при этом необходимо использовать рациональные доводы для оценки риска и пользы, чтобы обеспечить принятие решения, основанного на информации.</p>
			<h2>Диабет и курение?</h2>
			<h3 id="smoking">Курение</h3>
			<p>Обычно источником данных об отношении к курению является то, что пациент сам сообщает о себе. Однако, однозначных представлений, в каком случае пациент считается курильщиком нет. Разумно считать курильщиком человека, если он курил в течение последних 5-ти лет. Если курение прекращено за 5-10 лет до оценки, они при оценке сердечно-сосудистого риска, вероятно, пациент должен считаться некурящим. При этом, важно помнить, что курение также повышает риск онкологических и лёгочных заболеваний, и этот риск может быть необратимым, даже если пациент переходит в категорию некурящих. </p>
			<h3 id="diabetes">Сахарный диабет</h3>
			<p>Во многих калькуляторах оценки сердечно-сосудистого риска, данные о сахарном диабете приводятся в виде "да" или "нет" Во Фрамингемском исследовании сахарный диабет определяется, как концентрация глюкозы натощак &gt; 7ммоль/л в группе потомков участников и 7.8 (140) в исходной группе. Очевидно, что диабет некорректно оценивать как фактор риска при помощи "да" или "нет". На основании инструмента оценки UKPDS, каждое 2% повышение концентрации A1c после на 6%, повышает риск ССЗ на 33%. Сахарный диабет 2 типа также повышает риск поражения мелких сосудов. В сравнении с риском поражения крупных сосудов, абсолютный риск конечных точек, связанных с тяжёлыми микрососудистыми осложнениями, таких как почечная недостаточность и слепота, значительно более низкий. При этом, данные о частоте этих конечных точек не являются достоверными. В исследовании UKPDS 34 в течение 11 лет, почечная недостаточность развилась менее чем у 1%, а слепота - у 5%. В исследовании STENO, в котором оценивались пациенты с микроальбуминурией, за 14 лет наблюдения 8% в группе, получавшей стандартное лечение и 9% в группе, которой проводился гемодиализ, ослепли, как минимум на 1 глаз. Vijan с соавт. оценили 60 летних пациентов, страдающих сахарным диабетом с A1c 9%, частота необходимости проведения гемодиализа составляла 1 на 100, сходной была частота развития слепоты.</p>
			<h2>Почему такие факторы риска, как семейный анамнез сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний и образ жизни не включены калькуляторы по данны Фрамингемского исследования и ACC/AHA ASCVD?</h2>
			<p>В этих калькуляторах для оценки сердечно-сосудистых осложнений используются следующие параметры: возраст, пол, САД, общий холестерин, холестерин ЛПВП, курение и сахарный диабет. В калькуляторах не предусмотрена коррекция результата в зависимости от семейного анамнеза, массы тела, ИМТ и других факторов. Однако, мы добавили отдельные положения для оценки влияния семейного анамнеза и они могут оказывать влияние на общий риск, увеличивая его на определённую величину в процентах. Эти изменения были внесены без разрешения оригинальных групп разработчиков этих калькуляторов.</p>
